## Adding new posts

Adding posts to a jekyll site is as easy as creating a specific file name: `%YYYY-%MM-%DD-your_post_title.md`. Then add the following Front-Matter:

```yml
---
title: Post title
categories: [main-cat, sub-cat] # lower-cased. Max sub-cat depth = 1
tags: [tag-1, tag-2, tag-n] # lower-cased. From 0 to infite values
---
```

Start writing the post content just after the Front-Matter. The post will be visible once you have deployed the changes.

Since this theme is a fork of [Chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/), all of its [texts and typographies](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/text-and-typography/) are supported.
