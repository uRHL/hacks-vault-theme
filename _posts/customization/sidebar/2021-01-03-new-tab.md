### Adding new tabs

Create a file `_tabs/tab_name.md` with the following Front-Matter:

```yml
---
# the default layout is 'page'
# icon: fas fa-info-circle  # Tabs icons are disabled in this theme
order: 4 # Display order in the sidebar
---
```

Now update `_data/locales/en.yml` (and/or the locale you want to use) adding the new tab into the `tabs` key (around line 10). For example: `donate: Donate`. 

Ready! The new tab will be displayed once you deploy the changes.
